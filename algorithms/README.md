## Tip on sorting

`algorithms` contains the typical sorting/selecting algorithms.
I've been interested in playing with the commonly referenced

roughly  going through the tutorial as described in
[interactivepython][1], worth mentioning that I've been trying
to implement the algos on my own, with the description doc copied
from the webpage.
